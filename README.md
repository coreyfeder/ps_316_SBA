| Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll. | 5% |
| Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.). | 5% |
| Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task. | 10% |
| Create at least one element using createElement. | 5% |
| Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM. | 5% |
| Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content. | 2% |

Yes, I am! And yes, it does! It's still fresh in my mind and fingertips. 

Like many back-end thinkers, I find making design decisions to be truly torturous; it reliably takes far more time and causes far more distress than the skills purportedly being tested. I will of course push pixels as required, but I much prefer pushing bits.

And as noted, it's my own work. We're often being told to work smarter, not harder; and we're often told that engineers are lazy. Check and check.
